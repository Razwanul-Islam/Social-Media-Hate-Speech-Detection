# Social Media Hate Speech Detection using SVM
The Hate Speech Detection project is aimed at developing a machine learning model that can identify and classify hate speech in social media posts. Hate speech is defined as any language that is intended to degrade, intimidate, or incite violence or prejudicial action against a particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other characteristic.

The use of hate speech has become a growing concern in recent years, with the rise of social media platforms that provide a global audience for anyone with an internet connection. Hate speech not only has a negative impact on the individuals or groups targeted, but it can also contribute to a wider climate of intolerance and discrimination.

The proposed solution is to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a type of supervised learning model, to analyze text data from social media posts and classify them as either hate speech or not. The project involves several stages, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training and testing, and performance evaluation. The ultimate goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify and flag hate speech, which can be used by social media companies to enforce their content policies and protect their users from harmful content.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.10.* installed on your system. After installing Python, follow the below steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the zip file and extract it.

2. Open the command prompt/terminal in the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install all the necessary libraries:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
## Usage
To run the Hate Speech detection, you can either run the detection.py file directly or use the following command in the command prompt/terminal:

```python detection.py```

This will start the hate speech detection system. You can input your text and it will you output based on your text.

## Training and Testing (With Documentation and Code Explanation)
This project used svm as classification model. All the process is coded and described on 'training and testing(With Documentation).ipynb' file. To run a ipynb file you could install Anaconda that will handle Notebook file. Or you could use VS Code, for using VS Code you must install 'notebook' extension and install ipy-kernel to your python environment.
